# Spam-Classifier using Naive Bayes Classifier
<p>For better understanding of how spam classifier works we have divided it into 3 parts: <br> <br>
1)Pre-processing data:<br>
i)Extracting body of email <br>
                 ii)Pie Chart and Donut Chart <br>
                 iii)Text Pre-processing <br>
                 iv)Tokenizing <br>
                 v)Beautiful Soup <br>
                 vi)Stemming & Stopwords <br>
                 vii)WordCloud <br>
                 viii)Sparse Matrix <br> <br>
2)Traning Bayes Classifier: <br>
        i)Naive Bayes Algorithm <br>
                  ii)Joint Probability <br>
                  iii)Prediction <br>
                  iv)Data Visualization with Seaborn <br> <br>
3)Test and Evaluation: <br>
        content-> i) Testing metrics-> Accuracy, Recall score, Precision score, F-score <br> <br>

Naive bayes can also be used directly by using SCIKITLEARN as shown in 'Naive_bayes_with_scikitlearn' <br> <br>

Missing data is 'spam_assassin_corpus' which is to heavy file to put here but you can get the data from link below. <br> 
data was taken from - https://spamassassin.apache.org/old/publiccorpus/ <br> <br>

after exctracting data to 'spam_assassin_corpus' folder it should be kept inside 01_Processing and all 01_Processing, 02_Training, 03_Testing should be kept in same folder 'SpamData' to use above codes perfectly.</p>
